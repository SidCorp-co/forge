# scripts/

Project-level utilities. Each script is standalone (no shared lib) and has a comment header explaining its contract.

## check-branch-name.sh

Validates a branch name against the [Trunk-Based Development](../docs/guides/trunk-based-development.md) naming convention. Wired into `.githooks/pre-push`.

## check-source-language.mjs — English-only source policy

Fails if any `.ts`/`.tsx`/`.md` file under `packages/web-v2/src/`, `packages/dev/src/`, or `packages/core/src/` contains non-allowlisted diacritics. See ISS-65 for context — the project is English-only across UI strings, identifiers, comments, docs, and tests, after ISS-43 leaked Vietnamese copy onto `main`.

### Modes

- `--staged` (default): scans STAGED content of files in `git diff --cached --diff-filter=ACM`. Used by `.githooks/pre-commit`.
- `--all`: walks the working tree across all three `src/` trees. Used by CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml` `lang-check` job).

Exit codes: `0` clean, `1` violations found, `2` invalid invocation.

### Allowlist (per-line, evaluated in order)

1. **Brand-name literals** — small inline allowlist of foreign-glyph proper nouns (`Pokémon`, `café`, `naïve`, `résumé`, `cliché`, `façade`, `jalapeño`). If every diacritic on the line is part of an allowlisted brand, the line passes.
2. **Language picker entries** — line containing both `value: '<lang-code>'` and a `label:` token. Pattern: `{ value: 'vi', label: 'Tiếng Việt' }` legitimately needs the native script as the label value.
3. **`i18n-allow:` directive** — line ends with `// i18n-allow: <reason>` (or the `/*` / `<!--` variants). Same-line scope only; reason text is required.

### Bypass

`SKIP_LANG_CHECK=1 git commit ...` skips the pre-commit hook locally. CI cannot be bypassed — translate the offending strings or add an `i18n-allow:` directive with a reason.
