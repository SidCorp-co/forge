# scripts/

Project-level utilities. Each script is standalone (no shared lib) and has a comment header explaining its contract.

## verify.mjs — the conformance entrypoint (`pnpm verify`)

Run it after you finish coding, before you push — same slot as `pnpm build`. It runs every
conformance check CI runs, in one pass, and reports all of them rather than stopping at the first.

Hooks are an accelerator, never the mechanism: Claude Code hooks need a plugin, git hooks need
`pnpm install` and an env without `SKIP_*`. Anything correctness depends on has to be reachable from
this script with nothing but a checkout and node.

Four contracts:

1. **CI parity** — every `- run:` and named step in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` is either run here or
   declared in `CI_COVERAGE` as covered by another root script. `--ci-parity` proves it and is itself
   a CI step, so the two cannot drift.
2. **Fail-closed** — each checker must emit a file count that this script can read, and a count of
   zero exits `2`, not `0`. A checker whose scope matched nothing reports "clean"; forwarding that as
   a pass is the failure mode this guards.
3. **Report everything** — no early exit. One fix cycle instead of six.
4. **Advisory** — `cm impact` on every file changed against `origin/main`, including untracked ones,
   printing the guards / edges / flows you should read. This is the pull-side stand-in for the
   PreToolUse hook, and it works with no plugin installed.

### Modes

- (none) — full run
- `--ci-parity` — only the parity proof; cheap, zero-dep, no install needed
- `--no-advisory` — skip the `cm impact` pass

Exit codes: `0` clean, `1` violations, `2` a check could not run.

## conformance-status.mjs — declared level vs measured level

`.forge/conformance.json` declares a level per axis; this runs each axis's checker and fails when
the two disagree. Levels are shared across axes: `0` no checker · `1` measures but does not block ·
`2` baseline the old and block the new · `3` zero violations, no baseline.

It measures by **running** the checker, never by reading the manifest back. Every gate this repo has
lost was lost the same way — biome to 366 errors, `typecheck` to 84, the two length rules to 143 —
each of them described as gating something for the whole time it gated nothing. A written level is a
claim; this is the check that tests the claim.

Also fails when an axis is declared with no probe, or probed with no declaration, so neither half can
drift out of the other's sight.

## check-size-budget.mjs — file and function length

`packages/core/biome.json` owns both length rules; this owns only the baseline biome lacks. 102 files
are frozen in `.forge/size-baseline.json` — a file already over budget may stay over, it may not get
worse. Frozen per file (its length and its longest function), so a reflow or a moved function is not
a violation.

Adding a `cm:` annotation to a file already at its frozen budget will trip this. Re-freeze with
`--update-baseline`; the one-line growth shows up in the diff, which is how that escape hatch is
meant to be used.

### Adding a check

Append to `CHECKS` with a `scanned` regex matching that checker's own success line. Without one the
fail-closed contract cannot hold for it. If you add the step to CI too, add it to `CI_COVERAGE` in
the same commit — `--ci-parity` fails otherwise, which is the point.

## check-branch-name.sh

Validates a branch name against the [Trunk-Based Development](../docs/guides/trunk-based-development.md) naming convention. Wired into `.githooks/pre-push`.

## check-source-language.mjs — English-only source policy

Fails if any `.ts`/`.tsx`/`.md` file under `packages/web-v2/src/`, `packages/dev/src/`, or `packages/core/src/` contains non-allowlisted diacritics. See ISS-65 for context — the project is English-only across UI strings, identifiers, comments, docs, and tests, after ISS-43 leaked Vietnamese copy onto `main`.

### Modes

- `--staged` (default): scans STAGED content of files in `git diff --cached --diff-filter=ACM`. Used by `.githooks/pre-commit`.
- `--all`: walks the working tree across all three `src/` trees. Used by CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml` `lang-check` job).

Exit codes: `0` clean, `1` violations found, `2` invalid invocation.

### Allowlist (per-line, evaluated in order)

1. **Brand-name literals** — small inline allowlist of foreign-glyph proper nouns (`Pokémon`, `café`, `naïve`, `résumé`, `cliché`, `façade`, `jalapeño`). If every diacritic on the line is part of an allowlisted brand, the line passes.
2. **Language picker entries** — line containing both `value: '<lang-code>'` and a `label:` token. Pattern: `{ value: 'vi', label: 'Tiếng Việt' }` legitimately needs the native script as the label value.
3. **`i18n-allow:` directive** — line ends with `// i18n-allow: <reason>` (or the `/*` / `<!--` variants). Same-line scope only; reason text is required.

### Bypass

`SKIP_LANG_CHECK=1 git commit ...` skips the pre-commit hook locally. CI cannot be bypassed — translate the offending strings or add an `i18n-allow:` directive with a reason.

## check-test-signal.mjs — low-signal test guard

The test-side counterpart to codemap's comment rule: flags a test FILE that is mostly
declaration-shape assertions (`.columnType` / `.notNull` / `.hasDefault` / `.primary` /
`.isUnique` / `.dataType`) — assertions that restate what the declaration already says and
so can only fail on an intended change. FK `.onDelete` is deliberately not flagged.
Baseline-frozen in `.forge/test-signal-baseline.json`, same contract as the codemap
baseline. Wired into the commit path.

## upload-image.sh — attach images from a runner

Uploads screenshots/images to a Forge issue or comment over REST. Exists because the MCP
runner and CI hold a PAT or device token but **no user JWT**, which the browser upload path
assumes.

```bash
upload-image.sh --issue   <issueId>   <file> [<file>...]
upload-image.sh --comment <commentId> <file> [<file>...]
```

Requires `FORGE_API_URL` plus a token in the environment — see the script's own header for
the exact variable names.
