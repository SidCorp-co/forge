# Memory & Knowledge

Postgres `pgvector` + FTS memory with a cognitive layer: hybrid retrieval, usage tracking, semantic dedup, decay, fact extraction, and nightly consolidation.

> Sub-doc: [step-handoffs.md](step-handoffs.md) — per-step structured handoff context passed between pipeline stages (own table, not `memories`).
>
> Phases 0–4 of the memory-v2 plan are implemented (proposal deleted on ship, 2026-06-10); phase 5 (graph retrieval strategy, global scope) is future — see Known gaps.

## Overview

- Claude Code has no cross-session memory; Forge adds persistent, project-scoped memory.
- Memory is **pull-based**: agents are instructed (via prompt facts, `prompt/facts/registry.ts`) to call `forge_memory.search` / `forge_memory.write` themselves. Automatic paths: CI-fix-pattern injection into forge-code payloads (read) and post-job fact extraction (write).
- Storage is a single `memories` table in the same Postgres instance as everything else (pgvector HNSW + generated `tsvector`/GIN). No separate vector DB.
- The table is **curated, not append-only**: search hits bump usage counters, near-duplicate writes merge, stale rows decay to `archived_at`, and a nightly LLM pass consolidates.

## Data Flow (current implementation)

```
  Writers:
    issue create/update ──── lifecycle hooks ──┐  (best-effort, detached; issue delete removes the row)
    PM decisions / escalations ────────────────┤  (detached, logged on failure)
    PM policy create/update ───────────────────┤  (best-effort; delete cleans up row)
    CI fix patterns (reopen→developed) ────────┤  (source:'note', kind:'ci_fix_pattern')
    fact extraction (review/test/fix done) ────┤  (≤3 facts as source:'knowledge' + ≤3 knowledge_edges)
    forge_memory.write (MCP) / POST /api/memory┘  (strict; note/knowledge get semantic dedup)
          │
          ▼
  embed (LiteLLM-compatible; embed-input truncated at 8192, FULL text stored)
   — embeddings down? row stored with NULL vector (degraded:true), still
     keyword-searchable; memory-embedding-backfill (*/5) re-embeds later
          │
          ▼
  UPSERT into memories on (project_id, source, source_ref)
   — semantic dedup (note/knowledge, cosine > 0.85): a near-identical row
     absorbs the write instead (result carries dedupedInto)

  Readers:
    forge_memory.search / POST /api/memory/search   strategy: semantic (default) | keyword (FTS) | hybrid (RRF)
    forge_memory.get (MCP) / GET /api/memory        natural-key + JSONB metadata filter (no usage bump)
    ci-fix-pattern-query                            auto-injected into forge-code payloads

  Feedback (recall write-back, ISS-603):
    forge_memory.feedback / POST /api/memory/feedback   confirmed → stamp last_verified_at · outdated → archive now (evidence required); note/knowledge only

  Background jobs (pg-boss):
    memory-embedding-backfill  */5        re-embed degraded rows
    memory-consolidation       03:00      LLM CREATE/UPDATE/ARCHIVE (caps 5/5/10) from 24h signal
    memory-decay               03:30      archive unused note/knowledge; purge 90d-old archives
```

Comments are **deliberately not auto-indexed**: in a pipeline-driven project most comments are bot status chatter, and no automatic read path consumes `source:'comment'`. Agents that want a comment-worth lesson remembered write it explicitly as `source:'knowledge'` (see `memory/indexer.ts`). Job outputs are likewise not auto-indexed; agents persist what matters via step handoffs or explicit writes.

## `memories` table

| Column | Notes |
|--------|-------|
| `id` | uuid PK |
| `project_id` | FK → projects, cascade delete; every query filters on it |
| `source` | enum: `issue` \| `comment` \| `job` \| `note` \| `knowledge` \| `decision` \| `policy` (`comment`/`job` are currently write-dead, kept for compat) |
| `source_ref` | natural key paired with (project, source); max 512 chars |
| `text_content` | FULL text (≤100k); only the embed input is truncated to 8192 chars (`truncated: true` reported) |
| `embedding` | `vector(1536)`, **nullable** — NULL means a degraded write awaiting backfill; semantic search filters `IS NOT NULL`. Dimension hardcoded as `MEMORY_EMBEDDING_DIM`; boot asserts it equals `EMBEDDINGS_DIM` |
| `text_search` | `tsvector` GENERATED ALWAYS from `text_content`, GIN-indexed — keyword strategy |
| `metadata` | jsonb, queried via `@>` containment |
| `retrieval_count` / `last_retrieved_at` | usage tracking — bumped on search hits and ci-fix injections, not natural-key gets |
| `last_verified_at` | recall feedback (ISS-603): agent confirmed the row against live code; decay counts it as activity |
| `archived_at` | soft delete (decay/consolidation); archived rows invisible to all reads; a fresh write to the key revives |
| `embedded_at` / `created_at` / `updated_at` | timestamps (`embedded_at` meaningful only when `embedding` is set) |

Indexes: unique `(project_id, source, source_ref)` (upsert target — exact-key dedup), `(project_id, source)`, `(project_id, source_ref)`, HNSW on `embedding` (`vector_cosine_ops`), GIN on `text_search`.

## Module layout (`packages/core/src/memory/`)

| File | Role |
|------|------|
| `indexer.ts` | `indexMemory` (strict; degraded writes on embeddings outage; opt-in semantic dedup at cosine > 0.85) / `indexMemoryBestEffort` / `deleteMemory`; hook subscriptions for issue create/update |
| `write-service.ts`, `get-service.ts`, `search-service.ts` | shared service layer — REST routes and MCP tools wrap the **same** functions so validation and response shapes are identical. Services do NOT check authorization; callers must. |
| `search.ts` | strategies: semantic (cosine, `score = 1 - distance`), keyword (`websearch_to_tsquery` + `ts_rank`), hybrid (weighted RRF, k=60, α=0.7); `touchMemories` usage bump; topK ≤ 50 |
| `embedding-backfill.ts` | pg-boss `*/5` job re-embedding rows with NULL vectors (degraded writes) |
| `decay.ts` | daily 03:30 job: archive unused `note`/`knowledge` (0 retrievals > 30d, <3 retrievals > 90d; `last_verified_at` counts as activity), purge archives older than 90d |
| `feedback-service.ts` | recall write-back (ISS-603): `confirmed` stamps `last_verified_at`; `outdated` archives immediately + appends evidence to `metadata.feedback` (cap 10); already-archived rows noop |
| `extraction.ts` | post-job (review/test/fix) LLM fact extraction → `source:'knowledge'` + `knowledge_edges`; gated, detached, off without `LITELLM_API_URL` |
| `consolidation.ts` | nightly 03:00 LLM consolidation (CREATE/UPDATE/ARCHIVE, caps 5/5/10) from 24h pipeline signal; archive-only, id-validated, audit `decision` row |
| `llm.ts` | shared non-streaming `LITELLM_*` completion for the background intelligence |
| `write-routes.ts`, `list-routes.ts`, `search-routes.ts` | Hono REST routes; auth = `requireAuth` + email verified + per-user rate limit + `assertProjectMemberAccess` |
| `step-handoff-schema.ts` | structured handoff payloads (separate `step_handoffs` table — see sub-doc) |

MCP tools (`mcp/tools/forge-memory.ts`): `forge_memory.search` / `.get` / `.write` / `.delete` / `.feedback`, device-scoped via `assertDeviceOwnerIsMember` (writes/feedback: `assertDeviceOwnerIsWriter`).

## API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| `POST` | `/api/memory/search` | `{projectId, query, topK≤50, sourceFilter?, strategy?}` → `{hits, model, took_ms, strategy, degraded?}`. `strategy`: `semantic` (default, cosine-similarity scores) \| `keyword` (FTS, no embed call) \| `hybrid` (RRF — fused-rank scores, NOT similarity; degrades to keyword on embeddings outage). Semantic-only 503s when embeddings are down. Logged to `retrieval_analytics`. |
| `POST` | `/api/memory` | Upsert a memory row → `{id, embeddedAt, truncated, degraded, dedupedInto?}` (201) |
| `GET` | `/api/memory` | List by project (+ optional source), paginated; excludes archived |
| `DELETE` | `/api/memory/by-source` | Delete by natural key → `{deleted: n}` |
| `DELETE` | `/api/memory/:id` | Idempotent; always 204 for unauthorized callers (no id-existence leak) |

Write 30/min and search 60/min per user (`RATE_LIMIT_MEMORY_*` env overrides) — both endpoints spend embedding tokens.

## Invariants

- **Natural-key upsert**: re-writing the same `(projectId, source, sourceRef)` refines the row; re-writing an archived key revives it. Semantic dedup (note/knowledge, cosine > 0.85) additionally absorbs would-be-new near-duplicates into the existing row (`dedupedInto`).
- **Strict vs best-effort**: explicit callers (REST, MCP, knowledge ingest) get errors; hook subscribers swallow them (eventually consistent — a later edit re-indexes). Embeddings OUTAGES never error a write: the row lands without a vector (`degraded: true`) and the backfill re-embeds it.
- **Truncation**: only the embed input is cut at 8192 chars; the stored `text_content` is always full. Callers see `truncated: true`.
- **Auth at the edges**: every REST/MCP surface asserts project membership before touching services.
- **Score semantics**: only `strategy:'semantic'` returns cosine similarity — thresholds (e.g. the knowledge-dedup fact's `> 0.8`) must not be applied to keyword/hybrid scores.
- **LLM curation never hard-deletes**: extraction/consolidation can create, merge, and archive; purging is the decay job's 90-day-grace responsibility alone.

## Learning loops (current)

| Loop | Mechanism |
|------|-----------|
| CI fix patterns (`pipeline/ci-fix-pattern-learn.ts`) | On `reopen → developed`, capture (errorTypes, fileTypes, diffSummary) as `source:'note'`, `kind:'ci_fix_pattern'`; capped at 5 per error type; query side injects matches into forge-code payloads and counts them as retrievals |
| Fact extraction (`memory/extraction.ts`) | review/test/fix `jobCompleted` → heuristic gate over recent issue comments (correction language incl. Vietnamese always passes) → fast-model prompt → ≤3 `source:'knowledge'` facts (dedup ON) + ≤3 `knowledge_edges` with `issue:<id>` provenance |
| Consolidation (`memory/consolidation.ts`) | Nightly per-project: 24h signal (comments, status changes, **reopen cycles**) → LLM CREATE/UPDATE/ARCHIVE with caps, hallucinated-id guard, audit `decision` row |
| Decay (`memory/decay.ts`) | Usage-driven forgetting for `note`/`knowledge` only; lifecycle mirrors (issue/decision/policy) are exempt |
| Knowledge convention notes | Prompt facts instruct agents: search first (`sourceFilter:['knowledge']`, semantic score > 0.8), else write with a stable kebab `sourceRef` |
| Knowledge edges (`knowledge-edges/`) | `knowledge_edges` table: subject/predicate/object triples with `confidence`, `sourceMemoryId`, temporal validity; written by extraction, CRUD via REST — not yet a retrieval strategy (phase 5) |

## Memory candidates (continuous learning, ISS-534/554)

A confidence-accrual staging area **upstream** of `memories`: repeated pipeline signals accrue into a candidate before a human promotes it to a real memory. Signals never write straight to `memories` — they build evidence first.

- **Table** `memory_candidates` (`db/schema.ts`): `signal_type`, `signal_key`, `status` (`accruing` → `graduated` → reviewed/`archived`), `confidence` (default 0.30), `evidence_count`, `evidence` (jsonb), `summary`; unique `(project_id, signal_type, signal_key)`.
- **Files** (`packages/core/src/memory/`): `candidates-observer.ts` (subscribes to pipeline signals), `candidates-accrual.ts` (read-modify-write confidence accrual / evidence merge), `candidates-decay.ts` (ages out stale candidates), `candidates-service.ts` (list graduated / accept / reject / promote), `candidates-routes.ts` (REST).
- **Endpoints** (mounted `/api/memory`, auth = project `viewer`): `GET /api/memory/candidates` (graduated only, paginated) · `POST /api/memory/candidates/:id/accept` · `POST /api/memory/candidates/:id/reject` · `POST /api/memory/candidates/:id/promote` (graduated → new `draft` memory).

## Known gaps (phase 5, future)

Graph retrieval strategy over `knowledge_edges` (+ pagerank), `auto` strategy via intent classification, org-scoped memories (needs an authz story), MEMORY.md export for runner devices, cross-encoder reranking, contextual chunk prefixes for knowledge ingest. The 0.85 dedup threshold is inherited from forge-agents and should be re-validated against the configured embedding model.
