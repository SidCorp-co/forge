## [0.1.0-rc.1] - 2026-04-XX

### Added
- `forge/core` control plane: Hono + Drizzle + pg-boss + `ws` + MCP server at `/mcp`
- Dual-principal auth (user JWT + device token) with shared policy layer
- 14-status issue pipeline with WebSocket room-scoped broadcasts
- Device pairing: Tauri `dev` GUI + `forged` CLI daemon, shared Rust `agent-core` crate
- Session replay with 30-day JobEvent retention after terminal state
- `pgvector` memory store with HNSW index on `vector_cosine_ops`
- Email verification gate at first-project creation
- Apache-2.0 license; initial public release scaffolding
- Four clients: Next.js web, Tauri desktop, React Native (Expo) mobile (paused), and `forge/core` API

### Changed
- Control plane rebuilt on Hono + Drizzle, replacing the former Strapi backend ([ADR 0002](docs/decisions/0002-replace-strapi-with-hono-drizzle.md), [ADR 0010](docs/decisions/0010-clean-break-from-strapi.md))
- Vector storage moved from Qdrant to Postgres `pgvector` ([ADR 0011](docs/decisions/0011-pgvector-replaces-qdrant.md))
- Postgres image upgraded to `pgvector/pgvector:pg17` in both dev and prod compose, and in the CI e2e-web service
- WebSocket broadcasts changed from global fan-out to room-scoped (`user:<id>`, `project:<id>`, `device:<id>`)
- All clients (web, dev, app) repointed from `http://localhost:1337` to `http://localhost:8080`
- `forge/app`: `strapiMediaUrl` helper renamed to `mediaUrl`

### Deprecated

### Removed
- `forge/strapi/` package (archived to `legacy/strapi-v0` tag)
- `qdrant` service from `docker-compose.yml` and `docker-compose.prod.yml`
- `crossProjectAccess` MCP flag — every MCP tool call now requires `projectId` and passes the policy check
- `forge/test-flow.sh` legacy integration script
- `forge/tests/strapi/` test suite
- Strapi-specific env vars: `APP_KEYS`, `API_TOKEN_SALT`, `ADMIN_JWT_SECRET`, `TRANSFER_TOKEN_SALT`, `ENCRYPTION_KEY`, `STRAPI_URL`, `STRAPI_TOKEN`

### Fixed

### Security
- All five findings from the 2026-04-19 architecture audit closed by construction in `forge/core` (see [ADR 0001 §Context](docs/decisions/0001-device-runner-architecture.md) and the release-specific audit closure doc at `docs/security/audit-v0.1.0-rc.1.md`): row-level access checks via shared policy layer, room-scoped WebSocket broadcasts, `crossProjectAccess` flag removed, JWT TTL reduced to 7 days with `httpOnly` refresh-token rotation, Claude credentials never held on the server (device-runner split)
