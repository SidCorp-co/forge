## [0.1.0-rc.3] - 2026-04-25

### Added
- `POST /api/auth/dev/force-verify` (dev/staging only, ADMIN_EMAILS-gated) — unblocks QA on no-SMTP deploys per ISS-235 item H
- `forge/web/src/app/projects/page.tsx` — projects list page accessible from post-login nav (ISS-235 item I)
- WebSocket upgrade auth: `forge_auth` cookie (user) or `Authorization: Bearer` (device); 401 on missing/invalid; room subscribe gated by principal (ISS-235 item B)
- pnpm overrides for React types — fixes web build with next-themes (ISS-235 item A)

### Fixed
- `NODE_ENV` enum accepts `staging` (was: development|test|production)
- Logger uses pino-pretty only in NODE_ENV=development; staging/prod emit JSON for parity + runtime image compat
- docker-compose.prod.yml NODE_ENV now overridable via .env

### Validation
- E2E test report: `docs/release-tests/v0.1.0-rc.2-staging.md` (ISS-236)
- Bug #1 from rc.2 report (`/ws` 404) confirmed false positive — WS works through CF + nginx

## [0.1.0-rc.2] - 2026-04-24

### Fixed
- `docker compose up` now works out of the box: `core` service receives full env via `env_file: .env`
- pg-boss v10: explicit `boss.createQueue()` before `work()`/`schedule()` (jobs dispatcher, jobs/devices stale detectors, JobEvent retention sweeper, webhooks outbound)
- Core Dockerfile runs migrations programmatically at startup (`dist/db/migrate.js`); no `drizzle-kit` needed in runtime image
- Web Dockerfile rewritten to use pnpm + workspace context (npm ci can't resolve `workspace:*` for `@forge/contracts`)
- SMTP env vars now optional: when `SMTP_HOST` is empty, email send is skipped (logged instead). Email verification still enforced server-side
- `APP_BASE_URL` and `CORS_ORIGINS` default to `http://localhost:3000` when unset
- Broken `[ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md)` link in `docs/architecture/system-overview.md` (resolved to `../ROADMAP.md`)
- Added `docs/rfcs/0001-device-runner-architecture.md` stub (canonical content remains in [ADR 0001](docs/decisions/0001-device-runner-architecture.md))
- Test mocks updated for pg-boss `createQueue` API
- `pipeline-e2e.test.ts` multi-line `typeof import(...)` syntax (TS 5.7 strict)

## [0.1.0-rc.1] - 2026-04-24

### Added
- `forge/core` control plane: Hono + Drizzle + pg-boss + `ws` + MCP server at `/mcp`
- Dual-principal auth (user JWT + device token) with shared policy layer
- 14-status issue pipeline with WebSocket room-scoped broadcasts
- Device pairing: Tauri `dev` GUI + `forged` CLI daemon, shared Rust `agent-core` crate
- Session replay with 30-day JobEvent retention after terminal state
- `pgvector` memory store with HNSW index on `vector_cosine_ops`
- Email verification gate at first-project creation
- Apache-2.0 license; initial public release scaffolding
- Four clients: Next.js web, Tauri desktop, React Native (Expo) mobile (paused), and `forge/core` API

### Changed
- Control plane rebuilt on Hono + Drizzle, replacing the former Strapi backend ([ADR 0002](docs/decisions/0002-replace-strapi-with-hono-drizzle.md), [ADR 0010](docs/decisions/0010-clean-break-from-strapi.md))
- Vector storage moved from Qdrant to Postgres `pgvector` ([ADR 0011](docs/decisions/0011-pgvector-replaces-qdrant.md))
- Postgres image upgraded to `pgvector/pgvector:pg17` in both dev and prod compose, and in the CI e2e-web service
- WebSocket broadcasts changed from global fan-out to room-scoped (`user:<id>`, `project:<id>`, `device:<id>`)
- All clients (web, dev, app) repointed from `http://localhost:1337` to `http://localhost:8080`
- `forge/app`: `strapiMediaUrl` helper renamed to `mediaUrl`

### Deprecated

### Removed
- `forge/strapi/` package (archived to `legacy/strapi-v0` tag)
- `qdrant` service from `docker-compose.yml` and `docker-compose.prod.yml`
- `crossProjectAccess` MCP flag — every MCP tool call now requires `projectId` and passes the policy check
- `forge/test-flow.sh` legacy integration script
- `forge/tests/strapi/` test suite
- Strapi-specific env vars: `APP_KEYS`, `API_TOKEN_SALT`, `ADMIN_JWT_SECRET`, `TRANSFER_TOKEN_SALT`, `ENCRYPTION_KEY`, `STRAPI_URL`, `STRAPI_TOKEN`

### Fixed

### Security
- All five findings from the 2026-04-19 architecture audit closed by construction in `forge/core` (see [ADR 0001 §Context](docs/decisions/0001-device-runner-architecture.md) and the release-specific audit closure doc at `docs/security/audit-v0.1.0-rc.1.md`): row-level access checks via shared policy layer, room-scoped WebSocket broadcasts, `crossProjectAccess` flag removed, JWT TTL reduced to 7 days with `httpOnly` refresh-token rotation, Claude credentials never held on the server (device-runner split)
