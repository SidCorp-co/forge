## [Unreleased]

### Added

- A plan now records the branches that were weighed and dropped, not only the one that was taken.
  Forge keeps the issue rather than the conversation, so a rejected branch that is not in the plan is
  gone — and a plan without it reads exactly like one where nothing else was ever considered. Both
  plan-writing skills (the autonomous driver and the staged planner) ask for a `Rejected
  alternatives` section naming each branch and the fact that killed it, say that a forced choice is
  written as forced, and say that an empty heading is worse than none. What is checked is that the
  shipped bodies still ask; whether a given plan's rejected branches are real is prose no test can
  read. (ISS-883)

- `docs/VISION.md` and every proposal now say what adopting them costs the reader, and a gate keeps
  it that way. The constitution had a Boundaries section — what Forge will not become — and nothing
  pricing what choosing Forge takes from a team that chooses it, while the repo's own rule reads "a
  trade-off is priced or it is not taken". `check-honest-costs` refuses an absent section, one that
  prices nothing, and a `TBD` where the price goes; it cannot judge whether a stated price is honest,
  and says so. (ISS-882)

- Attention lists agent-filed `draft` issues that no human has looked at yet. `draft` is inert by
  design — the dispatcher never picks it up and nothing notifies on a draft create — so a proposal
  an agent filed used to be reachable from no surface in the product: measured 2026-08-30, 428 of
  them across 16 projects, all addressed to the account that paired the runner rather than to anyone
  who signs in. They now reach the project's admins, ordered by priority, capped at 20 rows with the
  real total shown; one human comment clears a row for good. (ISS-881)
